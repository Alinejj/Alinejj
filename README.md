This machine learning project focused on analyzing natural disaster data to predict the Consumer Price Index (CPI). It involved preprocessing the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and standardizing numerical features. Three different models were explored: Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost Classifier, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The models were trained and evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and cross-validation techniques. The project aimed to understand the relationship between natural disasters and CPI fluctuations, providing insights into predictive analytics and economic impact assessment.
